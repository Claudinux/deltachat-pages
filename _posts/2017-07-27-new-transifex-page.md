title: New Transifex page
---

Translating Delta Chat can now also be done via Transifex, a collaborative localisation platform that seems to be widely used.

Our page there: <https://www.transifex.com/delta-chat/> - Thanks to Transifex supporting Open Source projects!

I've uploaded the existing translations, but, to be honest, I do not know much about the system.

So, I would be glad, if someone else can maintain the page. Maybe one of the existing translators?
