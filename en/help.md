## General

### To whom can I write?

- With Delta Chat, you can write to users using Delta Chat - or any other existing
  e-mail-client. This is one of the biggest differences to other messengers:
  There is no need for the receiver to install the same app as yours.



### What are the advantages of Delta Chat compared to other messengers?

- _Independent_ of any company or services. _You_ own your data.
- Your data are not saved on a central server; this way, in contrast to most other messengers, Delta Chat even protect your metadata (who writes to whom?)
- You do not distribute your address book to anyone.
- _Fast_ by the use of Push-IMAP
- _Largest userbase_ - receivers _not_ using Delta Chat can be reached as well
- _Compatible_ - not only to itself
- _Elegant_ and _simple_ user interface
- _Distributed_ system
- _No Spam_ - only messages of known users are shown by default
- _Reliable_ - safe for professional use
- _Trustworthy_ - can even be used for business messages
- fully _OpenSource_ and _Standards_ based


### What, if the receiver does not use Delta Chat?

- The receiver will get a normal email then - if he replies to it, you will
  see the reply in the Delta Chat app.


### Does Delta Chat support images, videos and other attachments?

- Yes. Beside the plain text, all email-attachments are displayed as separate
  messages. Outgoing messages will get attachments as needed automatically.


### Does Delta Chat support HTML-emails?

- Yes.  If incoming email lacks a plain text part, we convert HTML-emails to 
  plain text ourself.  Outgoing emails always use plain text. 




## Groups  {#groups}

### How can I create a group?

- Select **Add group** from the "Sandwich menu" in the upper left corner of the chat overview.
- On the following screen, select the **group members** and hit the checkmark in the upper right corner. After that, you can define a **group name**.
- As soon as you write the **first message** in the group, all members are informed about the new group and can answer in the group (as long as you do not write a message in the group the group is invisible to the members).

### Who can add members to a group?

- Every group member has the **same rights** as any other. For this reason every one can delete every member or add new ones.
- To add or delete members, click on the group name in the chat.

### I have deleted myself by accident.

- As you're no longer a group member now, you cannot add yourself again.  However, no problem, just ask any other group member in a normal chat to add you again.

### I do not want to receive the messages of a group any longer.

- Either delete yourself from the member list or delete the whole chat. If you want to join the group later again, ask another group member to add you again.
- As an alternative, you can also "Mute" a group - doing so, you'll get all messages and can still write but you're no longer notified of any new messages.
